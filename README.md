### About Me

I'm Mary Grace Rivero, a student of the Ateneo de Manila taking Masters in Information Technology. I graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Science in Management Major in Legal Management. Weird, eh? I know IT is kind of far fetched but I really love what I'm doing when I'm coding. There's so much to learn in the field of technology and one good example is this data visualization. I created this data visualization to help aid in the traffic problem that people wine about in C5, most especially along Ateneo. When we were asked to make use of the traffic data provided and collated by the MMDA and Dr. Reina Reyes, the first thing that I thought of improving was traffic in Katipunan. I hope you like this simple visualization of traffic trends in C5!
